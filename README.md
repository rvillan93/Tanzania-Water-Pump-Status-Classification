## This project explores how to predict whether or not water wells are functional or not. The hope is to be able to build a model
that can classify these wells so that the people of Tanzania that have a reliable source of water. 

## Breakdown
	- One notebook that covers entire process from aquiring to cleaning the data.
	- Data cleaning section looks at various issues inherent to this data set such as improper construction dates and 
	missing data. 
	- The encoding section deals with encoding the categorical data so that the machine learning algorithims can process the 
        data.
	- Finally, the modeling section looks at multiple modeling techniques (XGBoost, Decision Tree, and Random Forest) to 
	attempt to find the correct model and hyperparameters that will create the best model for the job!
